_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     add a light source to the scene.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     light3d(theta = 0, phi = 15, ...)
     rgl.light( theta = 0, phi = 0, viewpoint.rel = TRUE, ambient = "#FFFFFF", 
                diffuse = "#FFFFFF", specular = "#FFFFFF")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

theta, phi: polar coordinates

viewpoint.rel: logical, if TRUE light is a viewpoint light that is
          positioned relative to the current viewpoint

ambient, diffuse, specular : 

     ...: generic arguments passed through to RGL-specific (or other)
          functions

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Up to 8 light sources are supported. They are positioned either in
     world space or relative to the camera using polar coordinates.
     Light sources are directional.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     This function is called for the side effect of adding a light.  A
     light ID is returned to allow 'rgl.pop' to remove it.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'rgl.clear' 'rgl.pop'
