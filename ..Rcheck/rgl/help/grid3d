_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This function is similar to 'grid' in classic graphics, except
     that it draws a 3D grid in the plot.

     The grid is drawn in a plane perpendicular to the coordinate axes.
     The first letter of the 'side' argument specifies the direction of
     the plane: '"x"', '"y"' or '"z"' (or uppercase versions) to
     specify the coordinate which is constant on the plane.

     If 'at = NULL' (the default), the grid is drawn at the limit of 
     the box around the data.  If the second letter of the 'side'
     argument is '"-"' or is not present, it is the lower limit; if
     '"+"' then at the upper limit.  The grid lines are drawn at values
     chosen by 'pretty' with 'n' suggested locations. The default
     locations should match those chosen by 'axis3d' with 'nticks = n'.

     If 'at' is a numeric vector, the grid lines are drawn at those
     values.

     If 'at' is a list, then the '"x"' component is used to specify the
     x location, the '"y"' component specifies the y location, and the
     '"z"' component specifies the z location.  Missing components are
     handled using the default as for 'at = NULL'.

     Multiple grids may be drawn by specifying multiple values for
     'side' or for the component of 'at' that specifies the grid
     location.
