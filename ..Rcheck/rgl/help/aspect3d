_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function sets the apparent ratios of the x, y, and z axes of
     the current bounding box.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     aspect3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: The ratio for the x axis, or all three ratios, or '"iso"' 

       y: The ratio for the y axis 

       z: The ratio for the z axis 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If the ratios are all 1, the bounding box will be displayed as a
     cube approximately filling the display. Values may be set larger
     or smaller as desired.  Aspect '"iso"' signifies that the
     coordinates should all be displayed at the same scale, i.e. the
     bounding box should not be rescaled.  (This corresponds to the
     default display before 'aspect3d' has been called.) Partial
     matches to '"iso"' are allowed.

     'aspect3d' works by modifying 'par3d("scale")'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The previous value of the scale is returned invisibly.
