_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Adds a sprite set shape node to the scene.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     sprites3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, radius = 1, ...)
     particles3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, radius = 1, ...)
     rgl.sprites(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, radius = 1, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 x, y, z : point coordinates.  Any reasonable way of defining the
          coordinates is acceptable.  See the function 'xyz.coords' for
          details.

 radius : 

    ... : material properties, texture mapping is supported

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Sprites are rectangle planes that are directed towards the
     viewpoint. Their primary use is for fast (and faked) atmospherical
     effects, e.g. particles and clouds using alpha blended textures.
     Particles are Sprites using an alpha-blended particle texture
     giving the illusion of clouds and gasses.

     If any coordinate is 'NA', the sprite is not plotted.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     These functions are called for the side effect of displaying the
     sprites. The shape ID of the displayed object is returned.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'rgl.material'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     open3d()
     particles3d( rnorm(100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100), color=rainbow(100) )
     # is the same as
     sprites3d( rnorm(100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100), color=rainbow(100),
       lit=FALSE, alpha=.2,
       textype="alpha", texture=system.file("textures/particle.png", package="rgl") )
