     RGL is a 3D real-time rendering device driver system for R.
     Multiple devices are managed at a time, where one has the current
     focus that receives instructions from the R command-line. The
     device design is oriented towards the R device metaphor. If you
     send scene management instructions, and there's no device open, it
     will be opened automatically. Opened devices automatically get the
     current device focus. The focus may be changed by using rgl.set().
     rgl.quit() shuts down the rgl subsystem and all open devices, 
     detaches the package including the shared library and additional
     system libraries.
