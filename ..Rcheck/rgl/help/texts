_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Adds text to the scene. The text is positioned in 3D space.  A
     bitmap font which is always oriented towards the camera is used.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     rgl.texts(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, text, adj = 0.5, justify, ...)
     text3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, texts, adj = 0.5, justify, ...) 
     texts3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL, texts, adj = 0.5, justify, ...) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 x, y, z: point coordinates.  Any reasonable way of defining the
          coordinates is acceptable.  See the function 'xyz.coords' for
          details.

    text: text character vector to draw

   texts: text character vector to draw

     adj: one value specifying the horizontal adjustment 

 justify: (deprecated, please use adj instead) character string
          specifying the horizontal adjustment; options are '"left"',
          '"right"', '"center"'. 

    ... : Material properties. See 'rgl.material' for details.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The 'adj' parameter determines the position of the text relative
     to the  specified coordinate.  Use 'adj = 0' to place the left
     bottom corner at '(x,y,z)', 'adj = 0.5' to center the text there,
     and 'adj = 1' to put the right bottom corner there.

     'text3d' and 'texts3d' draw text using the r3d conventions. These
     are synonyms; the former is singular to be consistent with the
     classic 2-D graphics functions, and the latter is plural to be
     consistent with all the other graphics primitives.  Take your
     choice!

     If any coordinate or text is 'NA', that text is not plotted.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The object ID of the text object is returned invisibly.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'r3d'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     open3d()
     text3d(rnorm(10)*100,rnorm(10)*100,rnorm(10)*100,text=1:10,adj = 0.5, 
            color=heat.colors(10))
